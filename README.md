Predictive Modelling for Apartment's Sale Price in Daegu, South Korea

Daegu, the fourth-largest city in South Korea with a population of approximately 2.4 million, is a hub for culture, economy, and transportation. Strategically located between mountains like Palgongsan and Apsan, Daegu is well-connected to Seoul and Busan through high-speed rail and highways. Historically known for its textile industry, Daegu has since diversified into electronics and manufacturing, fueling both economic and urban growth.

As land becomes more limited and the population increases, apartments have become the preferred housing option in Daegu. Offering efficient land use and practicality in the dense urban environment, apartments are often situated in strategic locations, providing easy access to public transport, schools, workplaces, and other amenities. In 2022, a survey revealed that 57.8% of residential properties in Daegu were apartments, totaling 239,000 units.

For apartment owners wishing to rent out their units, determining the right rental price is a critical task, often done in consultation with real estate agents or building management. The price is influenced by factors such as unit amenities, proximity to public transportation, and the property's location. Setting the rent too high can make it difficult to lease the apartment, while pricing it too low means the owner may not achieve the desired profit.

Understanding the factors that affect apartment demand in Daegu is key to addressing these challenges and optimizing property rentals. To help owners set competitive rental prices that also maximize profit, a predictive model using machine learning can be developed. This model would take into account various features of the apartment, such as unit size, accessibility to public transport, nearby office buildings, and schools. With such insights, both property owners and real estate agents can make more informed decisions when determining rental prices.
